# Release Notes

## X.X.X (YYYY-MM-DD)

-   Improved syntax highlighting for:
    -   text granules
    -   tags in text granules
    -   function calls in function call arguments
    -   flow control keywords vs. function calls

## 1.12.0 (2020-12-10)

-   Functions and object instances are now foldable.
-   Functions now display their cognitive complexity.
    A high score means that the function is probably hard to understand and may be hard to maintain.
    A developer should consider refactoring such functions if possible.

## 1.11.0 (2020-09-03)

-   [BETA] New document-formatting feature able to perform basic cleanup on your YML files.
    This feature can be deactivated using the Visual Studio Code settings.

## 1.10.0 (2020-07-17)

-   Named inline object instances now appear (like “normal” instances already do) in lists provided for autocompletion, via hover, etc.

## 1.9.1 (2020-06-02)

-   Fix a blocking issue with suggest lists causing the extension to freeze.

## 1.9.0 (2020-05-07)

-   New outline feature. This allows to see at a glance elements such as enums, classes, methods or object instances and easily navigate to them.
-   Improve hover display. It now displays element's signature instead of not displaying at all or displaying “Not Documented”.
-   Improve parsing for:
    -   `switch` expressions;
    -   attribute's value when the value is a list of HashMap entries;
    -   attribute's value when the value is a `ConstList`.

## 1.8.0 (2020-03-23)

-   New option `kaoFiles` allowing to set a list of kao files that will be used when initializing workspace's project parsing. This option is recommended for workspaces containing multiple related sub-projects, such as a library and a test project for this library.
-   Improve parsing for:
    -   multi type argument or local variable declaration;
    -   enums with attributes
-   Enum members are now available in suggest lists, hover and go to declaration.

## 1.7.0 (2020-01-06)

-   Fix a parsing issue that occurs when editing the value of attributes named `domains`, `domainsLevel2` and `documentation`;
-   Fix `*.kao` files parsing at startup (“F” and “M” types differentiation);
-   Improved parsing performance;
-   Improved parsing for:
    -   arithmetic expressions;
    -   text granules;
    -   rulesets and Rule objects;
    -   expressions using the `mod` operator;
    -   expressions with the `noDefault` keyword.

## 1.6.5 (2019-12-19)

-   Remove unused option `maxNumberOfProblems`;
-   New option `ymlParsingIssueSeverityLevel` allowing to set the way parsing problems are displayed;
-   Improved parsing for:
    -   `forall` instructions;
    -   `(condition).check()`-like expressions;
    -   `rename` instructions.
-   Improved location provider. `Go To Implementation` using `ctrl+F12` on a method name gives the list of the locations where the method is implemented. See [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-implementation) for more information.
-   Improved project files parsing. Fewer irrelevant files are parsed. The new behavior is as follows:
    -   parse the files mentioned in the `project.kao` file;
    -   parse `*.yclass`, `*.yobject` and `*.ycomplete` files;
    -   avoid parsing the files in `.generated-yml/` directory, wherever this directory stands.

_Note that parsing a whole project may take some time, depending on the project’s size. During the project parsing, suggestion lists won't be available._

## 1.6.4 (2019-07-31)

-   Improved parsing for:
    -   Hashmap keys;
    -   `switchExpr` and `switchExprExclusive` instructions;
    -   `applyCollection` and `applyCollectionOn` instructions;

## 1.6.3 (2019-07-23)

-   Improved parsing for:
    -   function or method optional argument list ending with a comma;
    -   function or method argument with alternative types, like `TypeA || TypeB myArg`;
    -   function or method having a `Function` object as an argument;
    -   `*.kao` files containing file name declarations;
    -   `as` instruction;
    -   `applyCollection` using the `__operation` operator;
    -   YML identifiers.
